I chose to do my 4 tiles on Seattle. The map will be avaliable [here](http://127.0.0.1:5500/458lab4/lab4.html). Some features I have included are zooming variety basemaps and a layer 4 tiles, audiece will able to choose to their likings. They will also be able to zoom in and out with the zoom level 9 to 11 on the Seattle area.

## First Tile- Monochrome

The second tile is a tsunami hazzard dataset on the washngton state taken from [Washington Geospatial Open Portal](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/waseocgis::all-hazards-alert-broadcast-tsunami-points/explore?location=47.625997%2C-123.444516%2C8.64). The red dots represent each Tsunami Hazards Broadcast Points. There are in total 122 record, from the above picture we can tell that most broadcast point along the coast of washington.

## Third Tile- Tsunami Hazards Broadcast Points overlaying on the Seattle Area

This tile is a combination of the monochrom mapbox basemap and the Tsunami Hazards Broadcast Points data. The monochrome gray background gives enugh guidance while giving a clean look.

## Fourth Tile- My customize mapbox basemap

This is the customize mapbox basemap I made to work with my dataset. I chose the dark gray and gray green color to give the creppy vibe, so people are scared and alert. The pop of red on the roads adds a dangerous feeling to the whole map. I believe my dataset will be red points on the map, this will bring great color contrast and alertness.
